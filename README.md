# Forest Fire Simulation

A scalable, cross-language forest fire simulation for research, visualization, and experimentation.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Realistic Fire Modeling:** Simulates wildfire spread across customizable landscapes, including wind and regrowth.
- **Functional Data Generation:** The data generation module is written in Scala using a functional programming approach.
- **High-Performance Simulation:** Core simulation written in Rust for speed and scalability.
- **Streaming Output:** Simulation results are streamed in NDJSON format for easy analysis and visualization.

## üõ† Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust** ([Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- **Scala** and **SBT**
  - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher  
  - [Install SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MadeInShineA/forest-fire-simulation.git
    cd forest-fire-simulation
    ```

2. **Build the Scala data generation module (functional programming):**
    ```bash
    cd data-generation
    sbt package
    cd ..
    ```

3. **Build the Rust simulation:**
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

## üö¶ Running the Simulation

Run these steps in order for correct data flow:

1. **Generate input data:**  
   The Scala module generates the forest landscape data. (The JAR is built with `sbt package`, and the Rust simulation expects this data in the appropriate location.)

2. **Run the Rust simulation:**  
   From the project root:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```
   By default, the Rust program looks for input data in the `assets/` directory and streams output to `assets/simulation_stream.ndjson`.

---

## üìù Configuration

- **Simulation parameters:**  
  - Customize data generation by editing the functional Scala source in `data-generation/Main.scala` and `data-generation/Grid.scala`.
  - Adjust simulation parameters for the Rust core in its configuration or in the Rust source.

- **Input/Output:**  
  - Input and output files are located in the `assets/` directory.  
  - Simulation steps are output as NDJSON to `assets/simulation_stream.ndjson`.
