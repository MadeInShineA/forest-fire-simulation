# Forest Fire Simulation

A scalable, cross-language, probabilistic wildfire simulation engine for research, visualization, and experimentation.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Rich Cell-Based Model:**  
  Supports detailed vegetation states including water, grass, tree, sapling, young tree, ash, and dynamic burning stages.
- **Functional Scala Landscape Generation:**  
  Initial landscape, regrowth, and ignition logic written in idiomatic functional Scala.
- **Fast Rust Simulation Core:**  
  High-performance engine for scalable, streaming fire spread simulation.
- **Streaming Output:**  
  Each simulation step is output as NDJSON for real-time or batch visualization and analysis.

## üå≥ Vegetation & Fire Model

The landscape is modeled as a grid of cells, each of which may be:

- **Water:** Unburnable, no regrowth.
- **Grass:** Burns rapidly, recovers quickly.
- **Tree ‚Üí Sapling ‚Üí Young Tree:** Trees progress through growth stages, burn in several steps, and regrow after fire as saplings or grass.
- **Ash, Burned Grass:** Track post-fire recovery for trees and grass.
- **Burning States:** Different burning states capture the stages and animation of combustion for trees, saplings, young trees, and grass.
- **Thunder:** Represents ignition points caused by thunder strikes.

Regrowth, ignition probabilities, fire jump (‚Äúspotting‚Äù), and wind amplification are all parameterized for realistic, tunable fire behavior.

## üî• Model Wind Strength Analysis
![fire_metrics_vs_wind_strength_averaged](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0638e764-9f95-4c26-afdf-ec1a59790ad6)

### Wind Strength and Burn Severity

This figure summarizes how wildfire intensity and landscape impact vary as wind increases, averaged over multiple simulation runs:

- **Left: Max Burned % of Burnable Cells**  
  Shows the highest fraction of living vegetation (grass, trees, saplings, young trees) burning simultaneously at any point, per simulation.
- **Right: Final Burned % of Burnable Cells**  
  The percentage of all burnable land that remains burned after the fire ends.

**Phase Transition:**  
At low wind, fire is limited‚Äîmost of the forest survives.  
Above a critical wind speed (near 20‚ÄØkm/h), fire jumps and wind amplification make large-scale burns much more likely, resulting in nearly total loss of vegetation.  
This critical transition appears as a rapid, S-shaped (‚Äúsigmoid‚Äù) jump in the metrics, driven by the model‚Äôs wind amplification and probabilistic fire spread.

**Model settings used for this analysis:**  
- Grid: 100√ó100  
- Thunder disabled  
- Initial ignition: 5% trees, 10% grass  
- Wind angle: 0¬∞  
- Wind strength: 0‚Äì50 km/h (step 1)  
- Each point: mean of 5 runs per wind level

## üõ† Prerequisites

- **Rust** ([Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- **Scala** with **SBT**
  - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+
  - [Install SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

## ‚ö° Installation & Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MadeInShineA/forest-fire-simulation.git
    cd forest-fire-simulation
    ```

2. **Build the Scala landscape/data generator:**
    ```bash
    cd data-generation
    sbt package
    cd ..
    ```

3. **Build the Rust simulation core:**
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

---

## üö¶ Running the Simulation

Run these steps in order for correct data flow:

1. **Generate input data:**  
   The Scala module generates the forest landscape data. (The JAR is built with `sbt package`, and the Rust simulation expects this data in the appropriate location.)

2. **Run the Rust simulation:**  
   From the project root:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```
